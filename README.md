Code Explanation
HTML: The main file (index.html) contains the gallery layout with each image wrapped in a div element for styling and positioning.
CSS: The stylesheet (styles.css) handles the layout, including the grid display and lightbox styling.
JavaScript: The index.js file provides interactive functionality:
Opens the lightbox when an image is clicked.
Allows zooming in/out of the image with buttons and the mouse wheel.
Closes the lightbox when clicking outside the image or on the close button.


Compatibility
The gallery is designed to be responsive, so it works across various devices and screen sizes. Additional media queries can be added in styles.css for custom behavior on different screen sizes.
